## Study

### Algorithms

#### 1. [(Difficulty: 3) Binary To Decimal](algorithms/binary_to_decimal.py)
#### 2. [(Difficulty: 3) Decimal To Binary](algorithms/decimal_to_binary.py)
#### 3. [(Difficulty: 3) Binary Search](algorithms/binary_search.py)

### Data Structures

#### 1. [(Difficulty: 2) Singly Linked List](data_structures/singly_linked_list.py)

### Problems

#### 1. [(Difficulty: 2) Calculate angle between the hour and minute hand of a clock for a given time.](problems/clock_angle.py)
#### 2. [(Difficulty: 2) Verify if a ransom note is from a given magazine page.](problems/ransom_note.py)
#### 3. [(Difficulty: 3) Find the smallest element in a rotated sorted array.](problems/minimum_rotated_sorted.py)
#### 4. [(Difficulty: 3) Find all possible permutations of a given string.](string_permutations.py)

Note: Implementation difficulty is on a scale of 1 to 5 and I tend to reduce them as I get more comfortable with the concepts or increase them when I update the implementation for better performance.
