    <h2>What is GoMind?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/surenderthakran/gomind" target="_blank">GoMind</a>
      is a simplistic Neural Network library written entirely in
      <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank">Go (GoLang)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>GoMind is built upon learnings from my previous article where I had <a
      href="/articles/tech/implement-back-propagation-neural-network"
      target="_blank">explained Neural Networks and back propagation algorithms</a>
      in detail.
    </p>
    <p>Soon after its release, GoMind became a proud member of <a
      href="https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go" target="_blank">Avelino's curated
      list of awesome go projects.</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Why bother?</h3>
    <p>I started learning Neural Network as an intellectual exercise and like
      almost every learning exercise it is best to set an end goal. In my case I
      decided on a two-dimensional self driving car simulation project, which I in
      my magnanimosity christened, <a href="https://github.com/surenderthakran/vaahan"
        target="_blank">Vaahan</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Over the course of the project I was forced to write my own computational
      geometry library, which I started calling <a href="https://github.com/surenderthakran/vaahan/tree/master/src/vaahan/gogeo"
        target="_blank">GoGeo</a>, for the of lack of any reliable library in Go like
      Python's <a href="http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html" target="_blank">
      SymPy</a>. Hopefully some day GoGeo will also get its own repositiory but it
      has a long journey ahead of it before that happens.
    </p>
    <p>Similarly after a while a need arose for a neural network library which
      gelled perfectly with Vaahan and was also simplistic enough for quick training
      exercises. But I would be lying if I said that I only wrote GoMind because of
      lack of good open source libraries in Go. No, the reason for starting
      GoMind is again educational. Afterall, what better way to understand neural
      networks than creating them yourselves?
    </p>
    <h3>Why Go?</h3>
    <p>I do realise that I can bypass many of my challenges if I moved away from Go
      but recently Go has been my language of choice for most of my personal
      projects because of its gentle learning curve, educated opinionatedness,
      built-in testing framework alongwith its beautiful set of tools like <a
        href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/" target="_blank">gofmt</a>, <a
        href="https://golang.org/cmd/fix/" target="_blank">fix</a> etc. There is no
      dearth of material on internet listing Go's many advantages.
    </p>
    <p><a
      href="/articles/tech/dockerized-development-and-production-environment-golang"
      target="_blank">Combining Go with docker</a> also creates a pretty smooth
      development pipeline.
    </p>
    <h2>Salient Features</h2>
    <p>Even though still in its infancy, GoMind attempts to provide a few
      good-to-have features for a neural network library like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Smartly estimates ideal number of hidden layer neurons for given input and
        output sizes (if not configured during model creation).</li>
      <li>Uses educated default activation functions for hidden and output layers.
      </li>
      <li>Supports the following activation functions:
        <ul>
          <li>Linear</li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function"
               target="_blank">Sigmoid (Logistic)</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)"
               target="_blank">ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)#Leaky_ReLUs"
               target="_blank">Leaky ReLU</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error"
        target="_blank">Mean Squared Error</a> loss function for back propagation.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Code specs</h2>
    <p>Every new push to the library is tested for Go versions 1.7 to 1.10 using
      <a href="https://travis-ci.com/surenderthakran/gomind" target="_blank">Travis
      CI</a>.</p>
    <p>As of <a
      href="https://github.com/surenderthakran/gomind/releases/tag/v0.2-alpha"
      target="_blank">release v0.2-alpha</a> GoMind has over 83% test coverage (find
      latest coverage report <a href="https://codecov.io/gh/surenderthakran/gomind"
      target="_blank">here</a>).
    </p>
    <p>GoMind also scores an impressive A+ in code quality on <a
      href="https://goreportcard.com/" target="_blank">goreportcard.com</a>
      (checkout latest score <a
      href="https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/surenderthakran/gomind"
      target="_blank">here</a>).
    </p>
    <h2>Roadmap</h2>
    <p>Following features are planned for future GoMind releases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Perform training in Goroutines to improve concurrency.</li>
      <li>Ability to import and export network model.</li>
      <li>Ability to pause and resume training.</li>
      <li>Introduce more loss functions in addition to Mean Squared Error function.
      </li>
      <li>Provide in-built epoch running for learning.</li>
      <li>Provide in-built batch learning capability.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Confession</h2>
    <p>While GoMind is nowhere close to machine learning giants like <a
      href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">Tensorflow</a> or <a
      href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/" target="_blank">scikit-learn</a>, it
      serves it purpose as a simplistic library for quick training in Go without
      worrying about C bindings or pre-creating models in Python.
